  <title>HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY from Nan</title>

    <h1>Nan's Mother Day</h1>
    <h3>A Mother's Love</h3>

    <p>This is supposed to be a Mother's Day gift...but, for whatever the reasons and explanations....it still is!
      In this life there are those that shall persuade us, and there are those that shall dissuade us. 
      But, the important thing is that it's in none others' control than our own.
      My 'Moms' have taught me that. And, no, I didn't make a typo...I have multiple Moms. It really took
      the Village to raise this one. A village of women, metophorically, in my life have caused this Awesomeness
      to be revealed to the world.

    <hr>
    <p>This is the part where, my ego dismisses itself and Life speaks in defense of it's dependents.
      <h2>This is my Statement of Life</h2>
      <p>Without Momma, there couldn't be any Life! So, when I say Momma
        it is my soul babelling for Life itself.
        Also, when we say Life....we know deep down that entails "Momma"
        I hope that this may touch someone's life. This was my first coding project ever, and I couldn't
        imagine a more perfect day than Mother's Day to have givien Life to such work, skill, and creative
        analysis.

      <h1>To Mothers Everywhere!....Thank You</h1>
